Color model -- Shell Aggregation Protocol
==========================================

The shell aggregation protocol is designed to perform steady-state relative 
permeability simulations by using an internal routine to change the fluid
saturation by moving the interface. The basic design for the shell aggregation
protocol is described by Wang et al. ( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.108966 ).
