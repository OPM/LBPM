Color model -- Fractional Flow Protocol
==========================================

The fractional flow protocol is designed to perform steady-state relative 
permeability simulations by using an internal routine to change the fluid
saturation by adding and subtracting mass to the fluid phases. The 
mass density is updated for each fluid based on the locations where
the local rate of flow is high.
